<div class="title">About Rainier Symphony</div><br>
    <p>
        Rainier Symphony is an artistically distinguished, 75-member community orchestra
        founded in 1981. The orchestra is composed of talented musicians ranging
        in skill from well-qualified students and amateur players, to internationally-renowned
        professionals. Our season includes five pairs of concerts plus an annual holiday
        concert performed at venues in Tukwila and other area locations.
    </p>
    <p>
        The orchestra rehearses Tuesday nights from September through May on stage at the
        Foster Performing Arts Center in Tukwila, which was designed by renowned architect
        Armand Marion. Our orchestra members are volunteers who have auditioned and demonstrated
        a high level of proficiency. Our orchestra draws from a wide range of vocations
        and professions; people who see music as an avocation and who love music.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Mission:</strong> To provide the finest community orchestra in the Puget
        Sound area by creating an atmosphere that attracts and retains musicians committed
        to individual and ensemble excellence.
