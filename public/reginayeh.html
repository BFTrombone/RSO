<h4><i>"Of all Ms. Yeh's many virtues apparent, including her interesting programming, her easy manner in speaking about the music to her audience, and her obvious commitment to bridging East and West, it was the passionate involvement in her playing that most struck this listener. She tore into Schumann's Sonata in G minor like a tigress, maintaining intensity throughout.... Ms. Yeh's fiery musicality is wonderful...... such communicative playing, meltingly beautiful."</i> - New York Concert Review, 2008 </h4><br><br>
