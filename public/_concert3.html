        Join us for a concert experience built on the idea of persistence, determination, and a relentless desire
        to continue moving forward, despite all obstacles. On this program, we’ll feature music by Verdi, Lalo, and Beethoven.

        We are thrilled to feature our principal cellist, Tom Walworth, on the Lalo Cello Concerto in February! Tom 
        is a long-standing member of the orchestra, and a splendid musician. One of the perks of an orchestra like Rainier 
        Symphony is our ability to feature our own musicians as soloists, and still present concerts of the highest art.

        Bookending the concert, the concert will open with Verdi’s Overture to Nabucco, an opera set shortly before an 
        impending war between the Israelites and a Babylonian army. After intermission, the orchestra will perform Beethoven’s 
        most famous work: Symphony no. 5 in C Minor. This piece is performed dozens of times annually around the globe and 
        hasn’t been performed by Rainier Symphony in over 25 years.
