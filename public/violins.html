<h4>Rainier Symphony Painted Violin Benefit Auction</h4>

Join us May 17 - 27, 2009 for our online auction of beautiful painted violins.  These incredible works of art were created by local artists exclusively for Rainier Symphony.  The artists worked with various media to transform real violins into one-of-a-kind art pieces.  All proceeds will sustain the Symphony's efforts to promote classical music. <br><br>

Go directly to <a href="http://shop.ebay.com/items/?_nkw=Rainier+Symphony+Painted+Violin+&_sacat=0&_trksid=p3286.m270.l1313&_odkw=Rainer+Symphony+Painted+Violins&_osacat=0">online auction</a>! <br><br>

Rainier Symphony has been committed to supporting our local communities for over 25 years, and continues to make this commitment stronger each year.  A primary objective over the last five years has been to reach out and connect with music students in our area.  Our youth outreach efforts include free concert tickets for children, and working with local teachers and youth orchestras to encourage the development of young musicians.  Please help us continue to fund these and other valuable Symphony programs.<br><br>
