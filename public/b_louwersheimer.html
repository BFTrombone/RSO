            <p>Benjamin Louwersheimer started playing cello at the age of eight. His first lessons were from Ian 
            Hampton (Purcell String Quartet) at the Langely Community Music School. In June of 2003, as 
            a 12 year old, he performed his first full length chamber recital in the Rose Gellert Recital Hall 
            in Langley. As a youth, he was a member of the Parnassus String Quartet which performed at numerous 
            functions including a production of “A Christmas Carol” with CBC Radio Host, Paul Grant, and  placed 
            first at the BC Provincial Finals (2004). </p>
            
            <p>Benjamin won the Abbotsford Symphony Young Musicians 
            Challenge (2004) and was the youngest winner of the Fraser Valley Symphony Concerto Competition (2006). </p>
            <p>
            As a soloist, Benjamin has performed multiple times with local orchestras in Chilliwack and Seattle 
            which featured demanding works as the Schumann Cello Concerto, the Dvorak Cello Concerto, and the Haydn 
            Cello Concerto in D Major. </p>
            <p>While completing a degree in cello performance at the Vancouver Academy of 
            Music, Benjamin studied with Brian Manker, principal cellist of the Montreal Symphony. Always an eager 
            student, Benjamin has attended the prestigious Master Classes at Orford, Domain Forget, has been a member 
            of the National Youth Orchestra of Canada, the Orford Academy Orchestra, and a returning musician of the 
            National Academy Orchestra of Canada.</p>
            <p>Currently Benjamin spends his time teaching privately, and in the 
            newly founded El Sistema program at the  Bakerview Academy of Music in Abbotsford. In October, he is 
            performing two full length chamber recitals in White Rock and West Vancouver with concert pianist Krystyna Tucka.</p>
