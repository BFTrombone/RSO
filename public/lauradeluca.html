Laura DeLuca, clarinet, joined the Seattle Symphony in 1986, and is a co-founding member of Seattle Chamber Players. She has appeared as soloist in Seattle Symphony performances of Copland's <i>Clarinet Concerto</i> and Robert Starer's <i>Rikudim</i>  (Dances) movement from his concerto <i>Kli Zemer</i>. Laura has performed extensively on dozens of recordings including more than 100 compact discs with the Seattle Symphony. She is also featured on many movie soundtracks, including the solo clarinet work on the Academy Award-winning feature-length documentaries <i>The Long Way Home</i> and <i>Into the Arms of Strangers: Stories of the Kindertransport</i>. Other chamber music activities have included a film score premiere by Wayne Horvitz, performances in Portugal with the Moscow Piano Quartet, and Seattle-area appearances in Music of Remembrance, Icicle Creek Festival and Methow Music Festival.<br><br>

Laura received her formal training at Northwestern University where she studied with the celebrated Robert Marcellus. A committed teacher, she has taught at University of Puget Sound, Marrowstone Music Festival and Cornish College of the Arts.<br><br>

 Laura will perform Mozart's <i>Concerto for Clarinet and Orchestra</i> again with the Cascade Symphony in November 2007 and will premiere a concerto that she has commissioned from composer Alissa Firsova in 2008. <br><br>
