        Our final classics concert of the season will focus on transformation, and will feature the music of Shostakovich,
        Higdon, and Elgar. Each of these composers have pieces that play with the idea of making something new out of something old.

        Our April concert addresses the idea of disguise and beguile. Each of the pieces on this program portrays some 
        element of transformation. Shostakovich’s October, Op. 131 acts as a commentary on the Russian Revolution of 1917, 
        where the Bolshevik’s took power. In this piece, we get a sense of before and after the revolution. Following that, 
        the orchestra will feature Dr. Erik Steighner on Jennifer Higdon’s Concerto for Soprano Saxophone. In relation to 
        the concert theme, this piece is disguised as a saxophone concerto, though it was initially an oboe concerto, then 
        adapted onto the saxophone.

        Following intermission, the orchestra will play Edward Elgar’s beautifully transformative composition: Variations 
        on an Original Theme, Op. 36, commonly referred to as the Enigma Variations. This piece is 14 separate variations 
        on one melody, which Elgar used as an opportunity to create an homage to multiple people in his circle. His ability 
        to enchant the listener with new ideas on the same melody is equal parts playful, thoughtful, emotional, and exhilarating.
