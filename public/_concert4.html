        Our final classics concert of the season will focus on transformation, and will feature the music of Shostakovich,
        Higdon, and Elgar. Each of these composers have pieces that play with the idea of making something new out of something old.

        Our April concert addresses the idea of disguise and beguile, and each of the pieces on this program portrays some
        element of transformation. Shostakovich’s <span style="font-style:Italic;">October, Op. 131</span> acts as a commentary
        on the Russian Revolution of 1917, when the Bolshevik’s took power. In this piece, we get a sense of before and after the
        revolution, and the tumult in between. Following that, the orchestra will feature Dr. Erik Steighner on Jennifer
        Higdon’s <span style="font-style:Italic;">Concerto for Soprano Saxophone</span>. In relation to the concert theme, this 
        piece was initially an oboe concerto, and has been adapted brilliantly for the saxophone.

        Following intermission, the orchestra will play Edward Elgar’s beautifully transformative composition: Variations 
        on an Original Theme, Op. 36, commonly referred to as the Enigma Variations. This piece has 14 variations 
        on a single melody, which Elgar used as an opportunity to create an homage to people in his circle. His ability 
        to enchant the listener with new ideas on the same melody is equal parts playful, thoughtful, emotional, and exhilarating.

        Bring those from your own circle with you and join us for a weekend of musical depiction and deception.
