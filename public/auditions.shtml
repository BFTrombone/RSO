            <p>
                Tuesday evening, August 30, auditions will be held for open positions and for substitutes, extras and
                utility players. For more information and to request an audition time, please email the orchestra
                at <a href="mailto:audition@rainiersymphony.org?subject=Audition Inquiry">audition@rainiersymphony.org</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you are interested in playing with the orchestra but unavailable to audition on August 30th, you may be able
                to schedule an audition at a later date.
            </p>
            <p>
                The orchestra uses any of several methods to determine whether an invitation to join the ensemble as a
                regular member will be extended. These methods can include traditional audition format before a committee
                and also sitting in with the orchestra at one or more rehearsals. In most cases, musicians will be expected
                to play prepared music of their choosing that demonstrates their musical abilities and familiarity with
                and command of orchestral repertoire. We recommend approximately 10 minutes of prepared material, which
                should include part of a major concerto and orchestral excerpts.
            </p>
            <p>
