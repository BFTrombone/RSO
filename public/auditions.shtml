                Rainier Symphony auditions qualified candidates throughout the year both to fill permanent positions and
                for our list of substitutes, extras and utility instrument players.  For more information and to request
                an audition at any time, please email the orchestra at
                <a href="mailto:audition@rainiersymphony.org?subject=Audition Inquiry">audition@rainiersymphony.org</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                The orchestra uses any of several methods to determine whether an invitation to join the ensemble as a
                regular member will be extended. These methods can include traditional audition format before a committee
                and also sitting in with the orchestra at one or more rehearsals. In most cases, musicians will be expected
                to play prepared music of their choosing that demonstrates their musical abilities and familiarity with
                and command of orchestral repertoire. We recommend approximately 10 minutes of prepared material, which
                should include part of a major concerto and orchestral excerpts.
            </p>
            <p>
                Rainier Symphony has openings for the following positions:

            <p>
