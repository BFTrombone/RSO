David Griffin is the fourth horn of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra. Upon graduating from Northwestern University in 1987, David 
began his career with the Rochester Philharmonic and followed with positions in the orchestras of Montreal and Houston before 
joining the Chicago Symphony in 1995. <br><br>

With the wind quintet Prairie Winds, he has performed in over twenty states since the group's debut in 1996.  Collaborating with 
composer Cliff Colnot, David transcribed long-lost music by Darius Milhaud from the 1939 film Cavalcade d'Amour.   The rediscovered 
music was arranged for wind quintet and utilized in a twenty-seven minute performing version combining film and live chamber music. 
The Prairie Winds gave the world premiere in July 2005 at the Madeline Island Music Festival.<br><br>

As a soloist, David has performed concerti by Mozart and Richard Strauss, the Saint-Saens Concertpiece, and the Britten 
Serenade.  Griffin has served as guest principal horn of the Saint Louis Symphony and the Shanghai Radio Orchestra.  He 
has appeared with Chicago Pro Musica, the Allegra Chamber Players, and Les Chambristes de Montréal.  David has been a 
faculty member at McGill University and Northwestern University. Summer festival engagements have included Grand Teton, 
Tanglewood, Manitou, Domaine Forget, and Scotia music festivals.  <br><br>

David, his wife Susan Warner, and their children Henry and Pearl live in Oak Park, Illinois. <br><br>
