    Robert D. Collins has conducted a variety of ensembles including symphony, chamber, and 
    pit orchestras, as well as contemporary music ensembles ranging from beginning to professional 
    level. He is currently working as a freelance Conductor and Horn Player in the Seattle area 
    and has conducted, in performance, groups such as Rainier Symphony and Inverted Space Ensemble. 
    While pursing a masters’ degree in orchestral conducting at Bowling Green State University (BGSU) 
    he founded Northern Ohio Chamber Orchestra (NOCO), an independent community orchestra, and served

    that is accessible and enjoyable for the whole community, while still challenging and developing 
    the ensemble. In Summer 2013 he made his international debut in St. Petersburg, Russia, where he 
    conducted the St. Petersburg Chamber Philharmonic as a Prize Winner of the Fifth International 
    Masterclass in Orchestral Conducting.
