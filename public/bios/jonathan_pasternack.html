    JONATHAN PASTERNACK conducts orchestras, opera, and ballet in the United States and Europe, with 
    such ensembles as the London Symphony Orchestra, Residentie Orkest of The Hague, Scottish Chamber 
    Orchestra, and the National Symphony Orchestra at the Kennedy Center, among many others. His debut recording, 
    leading the London Symphony Orchestra in Béla Bartók's Miraculous Mandarin suite and the Symphony No. 1 by 
    Johannes Brahms, released in January 2011 on the Naxos label, was hailed by critics as “superbly done” (FANFARE), 
    with “risk-taking, profound” Brahms (National Public Radio) and with Bartók sounding “especially delectable in 
    Pasternack’s hands” (The Seattle Times).
