    Michael Melnick has been performing with the Rainier Symphony for the past 12 years and currently serves as Principal Oboe.  Originally from California, he has lived in the Northwest most of his life and considers himself to be a native of the Seattle area.  At the age of 8, he started studying the Violin, which he continued for four years. At that point, his family moved from the Bellevue School District into the Lake Washington School district; which, at the time, did not have a string program.  It was during his 7th-grade orientation that the band teacher mentioned they needed an Oboist, and asked if he’d consider it.  Not knowing anything about the Oboe, Michael decided to give it a try and hasn’t put it down since. He credits his parents for always being supportive, providing him with private lessons all throughout Elementary, Junior High and High School.

    Once proficient on the Oboe, he auditioned into the Seattle Junior Symphony and later the Seattle Youth Symphony before graduating from Redmond High School and heading to the University of Victoria School of Music in Victoria, BC, Canada. There, he majored in Classical Performance studying with Alexandra Pohran-Dawkins; and minored in Operatic Voice, studying with Susan Young.  During his college years, he often performed as a member of Vancouver Island Symphony, as well as various community orchestras within Victoria.

    He would like to thank his parents, Gene and Ida Melnick for their constant support throughout his childhood.  He would also like to acknowledge the support of his husband, Justin Cavanaugh who comes to all his performances.
