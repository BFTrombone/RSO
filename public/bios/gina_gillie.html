    world-class musicians such as James Levine, Elliot Carter, Bernhard Haitink, Stefan Asbury, Herbert Blomstedt, Charles 
    Rosen, Barry Tuckwell and John Williams. Gillie studied Horn Performance with Douglas Hill at the University of

    enjoys writing chamber music for horn and other instruments. Her compositions are published through RM Williams and Veritas
