    Violist Vijay Chalasani is a versatile and commanding artist known for his imaginative and passionate performances. Equally at home on both modern and historical violas, Chalasani was featured as a soloist in performances ranging from the Mozart Sinfonia Concertante, the viola concerti of Hoffmeister and Telemann, Bach’s 6th Brandenburg concerto, and the Telemann Concerto for Two Violettas. Chalasani performs frequently with ensembles such as the American Bach Soloists, Monterey Symphony, Modesto Symphony, Musica Angelica, Albany Consort, Jubilate Orchestra, and Camerata Capistrano. As a chamber musician, Chalasani has performed with the Festival of New American Music, San Francisco Conservatory’s Chamber Music Masters Series, Silicon Valley Music Festival, New Millennium Series, and Live at Mission Blue. A champion of new music and modern composers, he has commissioned and premiered works by composers in Washington, California, and beyond, including work with the Guerrilla Composers Guild and the San Francisco Conservatory’s Viola Project. Chalasani is currently a co-director of the new music group Inverted Space, University of Washington’s resident contemporary music ensemble, committed to presenting contemporary music in contemporary venues and bringing performances of new classical music into the Seattle community through diverse programming, adventurous performance spaces, and casual concerts.

    A committed teaching-artist, Chalasani studied pedagogy and Suzuki methods with master teacher and Suzuki teacher trainer Judy Bossuat while concurrently teaching group classes, private lessons, and leading the string orchestra in the String Project at CSU Sacramento. Chalasani is currently a doctoral student at the University of Washington School of Music, where he studies with noted contemporary violist Melia Watras and is the Viola Department Teaching Assistant. Chalasani completed his graduate studies at the San Francisco Conservatory of Music, where he studied modern viola with retired San Francisco Symphony Associate Principal Violist Don Ehrlich, baroque viola with Bay Area favorite Elizabeth Blumenstock, and chamber music with the late Mark Sokol. His undergraduate studies were at CSU Sacramento, where he studied viola with Anna Kruger, and chamber music with Ian Swensen and Andrew Luchansky. In addition to the concert stage, Chalasani often performs in less traditional venues such as bars, cafes, and house concerts, and has collaborated in cross-genre performances with a wide range of artists including rock band Third Eye Blind, hip-hop orchestra Jazz Mafia, and indie-folk group Americana Orchestra.
