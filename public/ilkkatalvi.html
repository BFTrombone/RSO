Finnish born violinist Ilkka Talvi was initially self-taught and later studied with famous teachers in Helsinki, Vienna (Odnoposoff), Paris (Bouillon) and in this country (Heifetz at USC, Galamian at Curtis Institute). He first soloed with orchestra at 10 and played a sensational debut recital in Helsinki at 15. Mr. Talvi has performed as soloist and in recital in many European countries, as well as in many U.S. cities. Having taught the violin since elementary school, at the age of 13 he received his first teaching position and at age 20 became a faculty member at the Sibelius Academy, Finland's leading conservatory. His students have become winners of important competitions, both national and international, have continued studies at major conservatories and universities, and have had successful careers as soloists, orchestra members, including concertmasters, and teachers worldwide. <br><br>

Mr. Talvi has made numerous recordings, many of which have been world premieres, including concertos and other works by Bach, Hindemith, Diamond, Albert, Klami, Piston, Creston and many others, on Delos, Nonesuch, Angel, Naxos and Finlandia labels. He has performed regularly as soloist, in concertos by Tchaikovsky, Beethoven, Brahms, Hindemith, Shostakovich and Glazounov, to name a few. Mr. Talvi became the concertmaster of Finland's first nationwide youth orchestra at 13 and won a Scandinavian music competition in Copenhagen two years later. After immigrating to the United States he worked for the motion picture and recording studios in Los Angeles and served as principal in the L.A. Chamber Orchestra, before moving to Seattle in the 1980s. Mr. Talvi has served as concertmaster of Mostly Mozart Festival, Malm&ouml; Symphony, Waterloo Festival as well as the Seattle Symphony and Seattle Opera. For many years he worked with the renown Bach expert Helmuth Rilling in Germany and this country, playing as his concertmaster on a tour of the U.S. and Buenos Aires. <br><br>

Ilkka Talvi is married to violinist Marjorie Kransberg-Talvi, former concertmaster of the Pacific NW Ballet. Together, they have appeared on numerous series and festivals. Presently Mr. Talvi is busy performing and teaching both privately and at the Seattle Pacific University. This is his second year as concertmaster for the Rainier Symphony, an orchestra he is very fond of.<br><br>
