<div class="title">New Year's Eve Night in Vienna Details</div><br>

<h4>Please note that there is no Vienna Night scheduled for December 2008.  We wish you a wonderful holiday season!</h4><br>


Celebrate New Year's Eve in spectacular fashion as Rainier Symphony brings Vienna to the Doubletree Guest Suites. Highlights of the evening include a three course, Viennese gourmet meal and dancing accompanied by Rainier Symphony and the Chris Johansen Jazz Quartet.<br><br>

A master of ceremonies will guide us through the evening that begins with cocktails at 7:00. Your choice of three-course meal - Wild Mushroom Rubbed New York Strip Loin, Sake Seared Pacific Salmon, or Roasted Vegetable Wellington - will be served at 8:00. After dinner, relax and enjoy a demonstration of 1870s classical Viennese waltzing 
presented by the acclaimed <a href="http://www.straussdancers.com">Strauss Dancers.</a><br><br>

Then it's your turn to join in the fun and dance to waltzes, polkas, and other classics performed by Rainier Symphony. Not sure of the steps? Professional dance instructors will be on hand to help you stay light on your toes (and off your partner's).<br><br>

Later in the evening we'll jazz it up with the Chris Johansen Quartet. As midnight approaches, prepare to clink champagne glasses and countdown to the New Year.<br><br>

To top off the evening you may choose to stay overnight at Doubletree Guest Suites at a greatly reduced special rate. We hope you will join us for this unique New Year's Eve celebration featuring outstanding food, festive dancing, jazz ensemble, and a full symphony orchestra. Black tie optional.<br><br>
