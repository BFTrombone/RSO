    Interested in becoming an orchestra member?  We currently have openings for violin, double
    bass, horn, trumpet, and percussion, as well as substitutes for most sections.  We will hold
    auditions in late summer or early fall.  Rainier Symphony is a non-paid volunteer orchestra,
    and rehearses on Tuesday nights.  If interested, please send an email to
