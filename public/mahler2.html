<h4>Kathryn Weld</h4>
<img src="http://www.rainiersymphony.org/MahlerPhotos/Katie_Weld_BW.jpg" height="125px"; style="border:4px solid maroon"; align="left" style="margin-right:15px;"/> 
Mezzo-soprano Kathryn Weld comes to the Northwest, having performed extensively throughout the United States, Canada, Europe, and Japan. Her credits include two solo appearances with the New York Philharmonic, one with Charles Dutoit conducting and the other under the direction of Kurt Masur. She made her Carnegie Hall debut to critical acclaim in a performance of Bach's Mass in B Minor with Musica Sacra. While living in Germany, Ms. Weld was a featured soloist with such prominent ensembles as the Bavarian Radio Choir, the Consortium Musicum of Munich, and the Prague Philharmonic. Other international performances include those with the Sapporo Symphony and the Osaka Chamber Orchestras in Japan, the Mark Morris Dance Company, and the Philharmonia Baroque Orchestra. <br><br>

Within the Northwest, Weld has appeared with dozens of ensembles, including the Seattle Symphony, the Oregon Symphony, the Helena Symphony, the Wyoming Symphony, and the Portland Baroque Orchestra. With the latter she was heard in a live broadcast of Messiah on Nation Public Radio. Her 2008 appearances with the Seattle Symphony in Alexander Nevsky elicited strong praise for "her beauty of tone, a long line and a handsome shaping of Prokofiev's phrases". Seattle PI RM Campbell<br><br>

On the stage, Ms. Weld has appeared with the Seattle Opera, the Regensburg Opera Theater in Germany, Opera Carolina, Tacoma Opera, and the State Repertory Opera of New Jersey, among others. A recent opera review had this to say; "Weld has a remarkable voice, an expressive mezzo with an unusual timbre: full and warm with depth and a light vibrato shaping it" <br><br>

Acclaimed for her interpretations of lieder and contemporary art song, Ms. Weld is a favorite guest artist in chamber music concerts and in recital. Recent recital tours have included guest appearances in Paris, Moscow, and St. Petersburg. She has premiered the works of prominent composers such as John Harbison, Hans Gefors, and Bern Herbolsheimer. Weld serves as an Affiliate Artist Voice Faculty at Western Washington University and at Cornish College of the Arts.<br><br>
