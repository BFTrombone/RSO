                We are excited to be back in rehearsals in the new year! After a wonderful Holiday concert weekend, the orchestra is already well into our next Classics Concert cycle for our performances on February 24th and 25th. Please join us for a concert weekend that will feature music that is probably foreign to you, but is nonetheless wonderful repertoire by 3 very different Romantic composers. Beethoven's Consecration of the House is considered to be one of his most contrapuntal works, modelling the the counterpoint techniques of Handel. Following this will be the Violin Concerto by Jules Conus, a composer and violinist who was active during the turn of the 20th Century. This piece will feature our own concertmaster, Ilkka Talvi, as the soloist.
            </p>

                The second half of our program will round out with Amy Beach's Gaelic Symphony. This was the first symphony written by an American woman, and is very representative of the 2nd New England School composition style. With it's tumultuous textures and tuneful folk  melodies, Beach creates a sonic portrait of the trials and tribulations of early American Irish citizens and their struggles of daily life. Beach uses traditional Irish folk melodies throughout the work, along with some of her own melodies taken from art songs or song cycles that she composed earlier in her career.

                Please join us for "Unfamiliar Romance" concert weekend so that we may share these lesser-known pieces with you and your loved ones. Please note, these concerts will both be at the <strong>Renton IKEA Performing Arts Center</strong> on Saturday, February 24th at 7:30, and Sunday, February 25th at 3:00.
            </p>
            <p>We're looking forward to seeing you there!</p>
