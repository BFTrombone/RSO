                    What a fantastic year this has been! It has truly been my pleasure to serve as Music Director for the Rainier Symphony, and I am thrilled to continue these efforts in the coming seasons. I hope you, our patrons, have found our concert programs as enjoyable and as rewarding as we felt while performing them for you.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I want to thank the musicians of the orchestra for their hard work, for trusting in me, and for their unwavering support of the organization and each other. I would also like to thank the many volunteers who aid the orchestra on performance weekends - your efforts make it possible for the musicians to focus solely on creating a magical performance experience for our audience members. It goes without saying that the inner-workings of the Rainier Symphony wouldn't be as effective or as efficient without our wonderful Board of Directors. Their time spent working on administrative duties is ample, and certainly deserves recognition. Lastly, a huge thank you to you, friends and families of the Rainier Symphony. Without your support and attendance at our concerts, the experience of playing this wonderful music would only be worth a fraction of what it is when we're able to perform for you.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This orchestra is truly a stand-out group in the greater Seattle area. I look forward to presenting many more concerts with these excellent musicians. Please stay tuned to our website in the coming weeks for more detailed information on next season. Our concert programs and performance schedule will be updated in the coming weeks, so make sure to check back in to see what's in store for next year.
                </p>
                <p>All the best,</p>
