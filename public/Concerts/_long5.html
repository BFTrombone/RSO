        On this program, you’ll hear seven pieces with enough variety to ensure there's something for everyone in the family. Whether
        dashing down a mountain, stumbling upon a faun in the woods, watching a young magician get in over his head, or
        travelling to the fantasy world of William Shakespeare, you will be catapulted into a mystical
        depiction of enchanting and delightful scenes.
