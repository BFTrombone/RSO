        The season opens with concerts that take four unrelated pieces and weaves them together into one overall musical
        arch, similar to the structure of a multi-movement symphony.

        We open with a fitting piece to start a concert, Russian Easter Festival Overture, which acts as our first movement, and
        introduces the different voices within orchestra. After that, we have a Liszt’s tone poem, Les préludes,
        which introduces a melancholic mood, and is as introspective as it is existential. Following intermission, we have our
        third piece on the program, <span style="font-style:Italic;">The Moldau</span>, in place of what is traditionally
        the "dance movement" in symphonic structure. In this case, the dance is occurring within the storyline of the music, as we
        witness a wedding celebration happening on the banks of the river, along with a forest hunt. Lastly, our fourth
        piece, Sibelius’s <span style="font-style:Italic;">Symphony no. 7</span>, acts as the finale to our concert's whole t
        heme, as it mirrors some of the musical elements, and offers insight on the philosophical elements and ideas within the previous "movements".

        We hope to see you at our opening concert weekend, for what is sure to be the beginning of a wonderful season of music making!
