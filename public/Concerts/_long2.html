        Our December concert weekend will feature beloved holiday favorites, as well as traditional classical pieces
        that are associated with the holidays or spark the essence of the holiday season. Joining us on this concert will
        be Seattle Opera's Ryan Bede to lead the audience through a carol sing along, and to take the stage as our
        baritone soloist on some of my favorite Christmas tunes.
