        We are thrilled to feature our principal cellist, Tom Walworth, on the Lalo <span style="font-style:Italic;">Cello Concerto</span> in
        February! Tom is a long-standing member of the orchestraas well as a splendid musician. One of the unique qualities of an orchestra like Rainier
        Symphony amongst other community orchestras, is our ability to feature our own musicians as soloists, and present concerts of the highest
        artistic quality.

        Bookending the Tom's concerto, the concert will open with Verdi’s <span style="font-style:Italic;">Overture to Nabucco</span>, an
        opera set shortly before an impending war between the Israelites and a Babylonian army. After intermission, the orchestra will
        perform Beethoven’s most famous work: <span style="font-style:Italic;">Symphony no. 5 in C Minor</span>. This piece is one of the
        most popular pieces in the orchestral repertoire, and is performed dozens of times each year all over the world.

        Join us for a concert experience built on the idea of persistence, determination, and a relentless desire to continue
        moving forward, despite all obstacles.
