    Susan Reynolds began playing the flute in the sixth grade, and has to admit she selected
    the flute simply on the basis that it was really pretty.  In trying to escape a crowded flute 
    section, she briefly dabbled with the french horn in the ninth grade.  Through that experience 
    she came to realize the flute is really more than just pretty, and has been happily playing 
    flute and piccolo ever since.  After expanding her musical horizons in college with band, choir, 
    and orchestra, she didn't play very much after graduation.  Who wants to play alone?!  Then in 
    the fall of 1994 a musician neighbor invited her to play with Rainier Symphony.  In the years 
    since, Susan has become a strong supporter of community arts organizations.

    After graduating from Western Washington University with a degree in History and minors in Music 
    and German, Susan needed to find a job.  She has worked in the banking industry for twenty-three 
    years, and has been a project manager for the past eleven.  She has an MBA, and certifications as 
    a Project Management Professional and Six Sigma Black Belt.  With an analytical day job, Susan 
    enjoys expressing her creative side through music, and really enjoys the fellowship of playing 
    with Rainier Symphony and other groups in the greater Seattle area.
