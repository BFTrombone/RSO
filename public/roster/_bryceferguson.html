    Bryce Ferguson has been active in the Seattle Area music scene for over 40 years, initially as a percussionist,
    moving to tuba and finally trombone during high school. While attending the University of Washington, he studied 
    trombone with Stuart Dempster and Dennis Smith, former principal trombone of the Los Angeles Philharmonic. He 
    was part of the UW Symphony Orchestra that travelled to Washington DC to perform at Kennedy Center. He was 
    also a member of the Seattle Youth Symphony Orchestra during this time.

    Since his university days, he has performed with most of the community orchestras in Seattle, 
    most notably Seattle Philharmonic, Bellevue Philharmonic, Broadway Symphony (now Orchestra Seattle) and Philharmonia 
    Northwest. He was with the Federal Way Philharmonic in the Seattle Opera House for their performance of 
    Beethoven's 9th Symphony in conjunction with the 1990 Goodwill Games held in Seattle. He has also been a guest
    performer with orchestras such as Everett Philharmonic and Lake Union Civic Orchestra. He joined Rainier Symphony
    as Bass Trombone during the 2008 - 2009 season, which included a memorable performance of Mahler's 2nd 
    Symphony, "Resurrection".
