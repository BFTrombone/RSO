            <h4>February Concerts</h4>
            <p>If you purchased tickets to the snow-cancelled February concerts:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>If you purchased single concert tickets on-line, you will automatically receive a refund from Brown Paper 
                Tickets.  You do not need to take any action to receive your refund.</li>
                <li>If you purchased a season ticket package (whether on-line or in-person), you have three options:
                <ol>
                    <li>Discard the tickets, and the price paid becomes a donation to Rainier Symphony.  A tax receipt can be 
                    provided upon request; email <a href="mailto:questions@rainiersymphony.org">"questions@rainiersymphony.org"</a> if so.</li>
                    <li>Exchange the tickets for a concert in April or June 2019.  You can do this at the Box Office on the day of 
                    the concert, or mail them to Rainier Symphony with a note specifying the concert date (4/6, 4/7, 6/1, 6/2).</li>
                    <li>Request a refund of one fifth of the season ticket price.  To do this, mail the ticket(s) to Rainier Symphony 
                    and enclose a note with your name and address.  We will mail a check with your refund within 2 weeks of receipt.</li>
                </ol>
                </li>
                <li>If purchased through an orchestra member:
                <ol>
                    <li>Discard the tickets, and the price paid becomes a donation to Rainier Symphony.  A tax receipt can be provided 
                    upon request; email <a href="mailto:questions@rainiersymphony.org">"questions@rainiersymphony.org"</a> if so.</li>
                    <li>Exchange the tickets for a concert in April or June 2019.  You can do this through your orchestra member contact, 
                    at the Box Office on the day of the concert, or mail them to Rainier Symphony with a note specifying the concert date 
                    (4/6, 4/7, 6/1, 6/2). </li>
                    <li>Request a refund.  You can do this by giving the tickets to your orchestra member contact (s/he would bring them 
                    to a future rehearsal), or mail the ticket(s) to Rainier Symphony and enclose a note with your name and address.  Either 
                    way, we will mail a check with your refund within 2 weeks of receipt.</li>
