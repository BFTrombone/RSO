        The season opens with concerts that take four unrelated pieces and weaves them together into one overall musical
        arch, similar to the generic structure of a multi-movement symphony. We will feature the music of 4 diverse
        composers: Rimsky-Korsakov, Liszt, Smetana, and Sibelius.

        We open with a fitting piece to start a concert, Russian Easter Overture, which acts as our first movement, and 
        specifically introduces the different voices of the orchestra. After that, we have a Liszt’s tone poem, Les préludes, 
        which introduces a melancholic mood, and is as introspective as it is existential. Following intermission, we have our 
        3rd piece on the program, the Moldau, in place of what is traditionally the "dance movement" in symphonic structure. In 
        this case, the dance is occurring within the storyline of the music, as we witness a wedding celebration happening on 
        the banks of the river, along with a forest hunt. Lastly, our fourth piece, Sibelius’s Symphony no. 7, acts as the 
        finale to our concert's whole theme, as it mirrors some of the musical elements, and offers insight on the philosophical 
        elements, ideas within the previous "movements".

        We hope to see you at our opening concert weekend, for what is sure to be the beginning of a wonderful season of music making!
