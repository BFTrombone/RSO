<h4>Orchestra Member Policy</h4>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'>Revised 11/8/04</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><b><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;layout-grid-mode:line'>&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='layout-grid-mode:line'>INTRODUCTION:</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='layout-grid-mode:line'>&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='layout-grid-mode:line'>As an active and
performing orchestra, we seek both the musical and artistic growth of the
individual and the ensemble as a whole.  The orchestra is a place of community
where musicians can improve and polish their musical skills, while nurturing
similar growth in colleagues.  We believe that the resulting whole is greater
than the sum of the parts.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='layout-grid-mode:line'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='layout-grid-mode:line'>The members’
responsibility of preparation, punctuality, attendance, musical growth, and
respect to colleagues and to the ensemble is not only desired, but is necessary
to the success and longevity of the organization.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='layout-grid-mode:line'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='layout-grid-mode:line'>We realize that to be a
vital entity in the community, the orchestra cannot be an end in itself. 
Members must foster their love of music to others, who are our audience.  We
strive for quality in performance, for if we do not, neither the audience, nor
the orchestra community, nor the music itself will be served.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='layout-grid-mode:line'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='layout-grid-mode:line'>ORCHESTRA MEMBERSHIP:</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='layout-grid-mode:line'>&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='layout-grid-mode:line'>Membership in Rainier
Symphony begins with a successful audition.  After a successful audition, the
player is offered provisional membership in the Rainier Symphony with full
membership coming after three (3) concert series, by recommendation of the
Music Director and section principal, and with the approval of orchestra
committee.  If the Music Director and section principal cannot agree about the
recommendation of the provisional player, they will submit their opinions to
the Orchestra Committee for a final decision concerning the granting of full
membership.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='layout-grid-mode:line'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='font-weight:normal;font-style:normal;
text-decoration:none'>After a successful audition, each provisional member will
be assigned a mentor by the audition committee.  The mentor is a member of the
orchestra who will help the provisional member become familiar with the
orchestra policies and procedures.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='layout-grid-mode:line'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='layout-grid-mode:line'>A member may be
dismissed during the provisional membership period if the level of playing is
not up to the level shown during the audition or if there are attendance or
other issues.  See “Corrective Action / Dismissal” section for additional information.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='layout-grid-mode:line'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoHeader><span style='layout-grid-mode:line'>Current orchestra
members are not required to audition for continued membership.  However, if an
orchestra member loses his/her membership due to attendance or other issues, or
voluntarily leaves the group, then she/he may be required to re-audition as a
new player at the discretion of the Music Director.  See attendance, dismissal,
and leave of absence sections for more information.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='layout-grid-mode:line'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='layout-grid-mode:line'>Occasional players
(whether paid or unpaid) are those who substitute or play an instrument not
normally required (such as harp, bass clarinet, saxophone, etc.).  They are not
considered to be members of the orchestra.</span></p>

<p class=MsoHeader><span style='layout-grid-mode:line'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='font-style:normal;text-decoration:none'>OPENINGS,
AUDITIONS:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='layout-grid-mode:line'>&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='layout-grid-mode:line'>The concertmaster and
principal string players are responsible for interviewing interested string
candidates to determine if they have suitable skill level to play in the
Rainier Symphony.  Potential candidates are invited to sit in a rehearsal with
the Rainier Symphony with an audition scheduled at a later date.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='layout-grid-mode:line'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='layout-grid-mode:line'>Openings for woodwind,
brass, and percussion section positions, and all principal positions, must be
announced so that all interested musicians may audition.  Openings will be
advertised in publications and locations where qualified players will likely
hear about the opportunity.  Members are strongly encouraged to help in recruitment
efforts.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='layout-grid-mode:line'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='layout-grid-mode:line'>Auditions are held with
the Music Director, section principal, and Concertmaster. Other players may
also be included, such as other principals or other section players, however
the audition committee should not exceed 5 members.  The committee will make a
recommendation to the Music Director who will make the final decision to offer
the player provisional status.  The decision may be to accept or decline the
player, and may also be to republish audition notices to find additional candidates.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='layout-grid-mode:line'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='layout-grid-mode:line'>All auditions will be
conducted according to the “Audition Procedures” developed by the Music
Director and Orchestra Committee. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='layout-grid-mode:line'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='layout-grid-mode:line'>ORCHESTRA COMMITTEE:</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='layout-grid-mode:line'>&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='layout-grid-mode:line'>The Orchestra Committee
is made up of seven members, representing at least three of the sections of the
orchestra.  Two members are the Orchestra Representatives to the Board of
Trustees.  One member of the Orchestra Committee is the concertmaster.  The
other four orchestra committee members are elected by the orchestra members for
two-season terms, with two new or returning members elected each year.  There
is no limit to the number of terms a person may serve.  One of the two
Orchestra Representatives serves as the chair of the committee and conducts the
election of the other committee members.  Nominations should be made at the
first rehearsal of the season, and the election should be held at the next
rehearsal, by paper ballet.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='layout-grid-mode:line'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoHeader><span style='layout-grid-mode:line'>The Committee shall meet
regularly, with a minimum of one meeting per concert series.  A simple majority
of committee members constitutes a quorum.</span></p>

principal players are expected to play a leadership role in their section and
to work closely with other section leaders to maintain a quality performance,
even in the event they are unable to participate in a concert series. 
Principals should work within their section to assist with part distribution,
answering questions, and encouraging the growth of musicality and ensemble. 
Principals should also assist with recruiting new players and substitutes.</span></p>

the series leading up to the next concert, the Music Director will coordinate

circumstances of any such change in assignment and make a determination as to
whether a lack of justification exists or whether favoritism or punitive intent
played any part in the change.  Upon such a finding, the Orchestra Committee

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='layout-grid-mode:line'>Recognizing the
responsibility of a community orchestra to mentor young musicians, and the
value of experience in their learning process, student musicians are invited to
audition to become student members.  At the discretion of the Music Director,
and with the concurrence of the concertmaster and section principal, the
Rainier Symphony may accept qualified and responsible young musicians as
student members.  As student members certain allowances, such as attendance,
may be granted. The Music Director will determine whether the student member
performs in a concert.</span></p>

entitled to one complimentary ticket to each concert series she/he plays if
attendance requirements have been met (a “series” is two or more concerts where
the same music is played).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='layout-grid-mode:line'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='layout-grid-mode:line'>Members are encouraged
to sell advance tickets.  These may be sold at a $2 discount.  A volunteer is
responsible for distributing, tracking, and reporting to the Ticket Sales
Coordinator all tickets sold by the orchestra, and complimentary tickets given
to orchestra members for each concert series.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='layout-grid-mode:line'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='layout-grid-mode:line'>Orchestra members shall
request the amount of tickets they anticipate they will sell at the rehearsal
no later than 3 weeks prior to the concert series.  The complimentary ticket,
if desired, shall be requested at the rehearsal no later than 2 weeks prior to
the concert.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='layout-grid-mode:line'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='layout-grid-mode:line'>Ticket orders will
usually be ready for pickup from the volunteer at the following rehearsal. 
Money and unsold tickets are to be returned to the volunteer by the dress
rehearsal of the concert series.  This is to allow enough time to tally and
report ticket sales to the Ticket Sales Coordinator prior to the first concert
in the series.  We want to be sure that we know exactly how many tickets are
available to sell at the door so we do not oversell.  Also, if a player will
not be using his/her complimentary ticket, please return it so it may be sold.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='layout-grid-mode:line'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='layout-grid-mode:line'>If a player checks out
tickets and returns them by the deadline, the tickets do not have to be paid

seats are available, but not refunded.</span></p>

<h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='layout-grid-mode:line'>The Rainier Symphony
desires to accommodate players with personal needs that require their absence,
while also balancing the musical needs of the ensemble.  Members taking time
away from the orchestra may return according to the policy below.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='layout-grid-mode:line'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<h3>SINGLE CONCERT SERIES LEAVE OF ABSENCE</h3>

<ol style='margin-top:0in' start=1 type=A>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span style='layout-grid-mode:line'>This policy is used
     when a member will miss all of the concerts in a given series.  If a
     member can attend all rehearsals and will only miss one concert in the
     series, the member should speak with the Music Director to see if this is
     acceptable (in which case this policy does not apply), or whether the
     member should not play for the entire series (in which case this policy
     would apply).  A member in need of a single concert series leave of
     absence must submit a written request (letter or email) to the Orchestra
     Committee no later than 30 days prior to the first rehearsal of the
     concert series to be missed.  Requests after this period will be accepted
     only in the case of family or personal emergency, or physical injury. 
     Members must submit requests as soon as the need becomes known and should
     not wait until 30 days prior to rehearsal.</span></li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span style='layout-grid-mode:line'>A member shall
     automatically be allowed one leave of absence per season, if the written
     request requirement has been met.</span></li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span style='layout-grid-mode:line'>Failure to meet the
     written request requirement for a single concert series leave of absence
     will be grounds for membership review by the Orchestra Committee.  See the
     “Orchestra Membership” section for membership process.</span></li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span style='layout-grid-mode:line'>If the member is a
     string principal, or any woodwind, brass, or percussion player, the member
     will assist in finding a qualified substitute.  If the member is a section
     string player (not a string principal), the member should consult with the
     Concertmaster to determine if a substitute is needed.</span></li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span style='layout-grid-mode:line'>Additional leaves will
     be allowed for members with demonstrated professional or personal
     conflicts, however these must be approved in advance by the Orchestra
     Committee, with final approval by the Music Director.</span></li>
</ol>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='layout-grid-mode:line'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<h3>SEASON-LONG LEAVE OF ABSENCE</h3>

<ol style='margin-top:0in' start=1 type=A>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span style='layout-grid-mode:line'>A member of at least
     one year in need of a season-long leave of absence must submit a written
     request (letter or email) to the Orchestra Manager, who will forward it to
     the Orchestra Committee, no later than August 1 for the season beginning
     in September.  If a member does not submit a written request for a
     season-long leave of absence, membership in the Rainier Symphony is discontinued. 
     See the “Orchestra Membership” section for membership process.</span></li>

      string principal, or any woodwind, brass, or percussion player, the
      member will assist in finding a qualified substitute.  If the member is a
      section string player (not a string principal), the member should consult
      with the Concertmaster to determine if a substitute is needed.</span></li>
  <li class=MsoNormal><span style='layout-grid-mode:line'>The member will
      return to the orchestra after his/her leave of absence with the same or
      higher level of playing.</span></li>

      Committee will notify the member in writing (letter or email) of the

      to change any conditions, the member must contact the Orchestra
      Committee, and any changes must be confirmed in writing.</span></li>
  <li class=MsoNormal><span style='layout-grid-mode:line'>If the conditions
      upon which the leave of absence are met by the member, the member’s seat
      will be returned after his/her leave of absence.</span></li>
  <li class=MsoNormal><span style='layout-grid-mode:line'>The substitute for
      the member will be clearly informed in advance that his/her position in
      the Rainier Symphony is only for the duration of the member’s leave of

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='layout-grid-mode:line'>Should there be any
dispute regarding the application of any part of the Orchestra Member policy,
the matter will be decided by a two-thirds (2/3) majority vote of the entire
Orchestra Committee and the concurrence of the Music Director.  If the Music
Director does not concur, a unanimous vote of the entire Orchestra Committee
overrides the Music Director’s veto as the final authority.</span></p>
